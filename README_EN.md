## FAQ 📥
- Relationship between [LinguaGacha](https://github.com/neavo/LinguaGacha) and [AiNiee](https://github.com/NEKOparapa/AiNiee)
  - The author of `LinguaGacha` is one of the main developers and maintainers of `AiNiee v5`.
  - The UI framework of `AiNiee v5` and its continuation in `AiNiee v6` was also primarily designed and developed by the author.
  - This is why the UIs are similar; the author ran out of inspiration for a new design, please forgive me 🤣
  - However, `LinguaGacha` is not a fork of `AiNiee`, but a completely new translator application developed based on that experience.
  - Compared to `AiNiee v5`, which the author primarily developed, `LinguaGacha` has some unique advantages, including but not limited to:
    - Zero configuration; optimal translation quality and speed are achieved with all default settings.
    - Better performance optimization; even with 512+ concurrent tasks, the computer won't lag, and the actual translation speed is faster.
    - Native support for `.rpy` and `.trans` project files, enabling instant play for most `RenPy` and `RPGMaker` games.
    - Better support for file formats, e.g., `.epub` format can preserve almost all original styles.
    - More complete pre-processing, post-processing, and result checking features
      - Significantly reducing the workload of proofreading to produce high-quality translations.
